# memory-cards-game

This is a simple Memory Card Matching Game built using Vue 3 and TypeScript. The game consists of a grid of face-down cards, each having a matching pair. Players flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs. If the selected cards match, they remain face-up; otherwise, they flip back over after a short delay. The objective is to match all pairs in the least number of moves.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration
